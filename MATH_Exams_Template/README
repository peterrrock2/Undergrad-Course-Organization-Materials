This project is set up to contain all the material that you need to make the exams for the 
semester. Below is a detailed account of what each file within this project contains, and how 
to set up the entire project for the semester

Note: This project was made with Overleaf's file dynamics in mind. Using this on your personal
computer may require some additional editing

================================================================================================
                                     BEGINNING OF SEMESTER
================================================================================================

Access the file named "frontpage.tex" inside of the Resources folder, and add or edit each of 
the lines to include all of the sections. For example, if you wanted to add section 002 taught
by Peter Rock from 8:00 - 8:50, you would add the following line to the tabular environment:

$\square$ & Section 002 & Peter Rock   & 8:00am - 8:50am \\

After editing the front page, make sure to go through each of the "exam*.tex" files in the Exam
folders to edit the lines for the class, date, exam number, and duration. Here is an example
from Exam 1:

\newcommand{\CLASS}{MATH 2400}
\newcommand{\DATE}{February 13, 2023}
\newcommand{\EXAM}{Midterm 1}
\newcommand{\DURATION}{90 minutes}


================================================================================================
                                 ADDING QUESTIONS TO EXAMS
================================================================================================

Each of the exams is sequestered in its own folder. Within each of the exam folders, you will
find a "Graphics" folder for storing all of the images needed to generate the exam and a 
"Problems" folder for holding the *.tex files containing all of the problems on the exam. 
There is a Multiple Choice file labeled "MC.tex" and a Free Response file labeled "FR.tex" 
within this folder, the purpose of which should be clear.



                             +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
                             ++ BASIC QUESTION FORMATTING ++
                             +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Each question within the MC.tex and FR.tex files should be separated using the following set 
of commented lines:
%===========================================================
%               QUESTION - By Author Name
%===========================================================
This helps the exam readers to both find the questions to make edits, and to identify who 
made what questions on the exam so that we can delegate question editing.



                                +++++++++++++++++++++
                                ++ MULTIPLE CHOICE ++
                                +++++++++++++++++++++

All multiple-choice questions should begin with the following line:

\question MULTIPLE CHOICE: Circle the correct answer. You do not need to show any work.

Options on the multiple choice should then be enumerated using the choices environment with
the correct choice being highlighted using the \correctchoice option. For example

\begin{randomizechoices}
\choice Thing 1
\choice Thing 2
\choice Thing 3
\correctchoice Thing 4
\end{randomizechoices}

In this case, the fourth option will be highlighted as the correct choice when the line

% \printanswerstrue  % UNCOMMENT TO SEE ANSWERS

is uncommented in the exam document


Of course, if you would like a little more control over the ordering of the choices in the 
various versions of the exam, you can use if statements. Here is an example:

\ifnum\VERSION=1
\begin{choices}
    \choice Thing 1
    \choice Thing 2
    \choice Thing 3
    \correctchoice Thing 4
\end{choices}
\fi\ifnum\VERSION=2
\begin{choices}
    \correctchoice Thing 4
    \choice Thing 1
    \choice Thing 3
    \choice Thing 2
\end{choices}
\fi\ifnum\VERSION=3
\begin{choices}
    \choice Thing 3
    \correctchoice Thing 4
    \choice Thing 1
    \choice Thing 2
\end{choices}
\fi


                                +++++++++++++++++++
                                ++ FREE RESPONSE ++
                                +++++++++++++++++++

All free response questions need to be proceeded by the \question[# of points]. So to make a 
free response question worth 6 points, you would use

\question[6] Text of the free response.

If you desire to make a free response worth a total of 6 points, but with two parts worth 4
points and 2 points respectively, note that you need to omit the points after \question
and instead use the "parts" environment. For example

\question Text of multi-part free response question worth 6 points total

\begin{parts}
\part[4] This is a part worth 4 points
\part[2] This is a part worth 2 points
\end{parts}

As a helpful note, you may achieve some nice spacing using either \vfill or \vspace{space_size}
between each part.

                                  ++ GRAPHICS ++
                                  ++++++++++++++


To include graphics, put your image in the "Graphics" folder and then use the command

\includegraphics[]{Graphics/IMAGE_NAME}

For example, the image in the example free response question was included using the following:

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{Graphics/example_graphic.jpg}
\end{center}
