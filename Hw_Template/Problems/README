All of the files in these subfolders need to be labeled sequentially. That means that you CANNOT just go 
and delete any file that you feel like. If you must delete a file, please run the included 'delete_file.py' 
script so that the problems remain correctly numbered for the random problem generator.

Likewise, if you would like to insert a file, use the included 'insert_file.py' script. This is useful for
keeping the textbook problems in order as they appear in the text, and for keeping the problems that we 
write for the non-textbook and additional problems in a relatively nice order.

IMPORTANT NOTE: for the solution environment to work, you have to move\begin{solution} and \end{solution}
onto their own line, and they have to be all the way to the left
